# Pipes

## Why

- I want to transfrom the data that is going to be rendered in the template.
- There are two ways to do so.
- I can do it in the model itself and view will automatically recieve transformed value.
- Or I can do it in the template also.

## Disadvantages of tranforming data in the model

- We want to transform a property in the class.
- We need to ensure that our transform function runs whenever the class property changes.
- No reusability. I can reuse the transform function by usingit in a service, but still I need to inject service in all the 
components and run transformation logic whenever data changes.

## What are pipes

- Pipes are functions used in the template, that takes some input and return a transformed value.
- Returned value is then rendered in the view.
