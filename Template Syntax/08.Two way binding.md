# Two way binding

## General event pattern (Let's consider an input field)

- We have a state variable to initialize the value.
- Data flows from our model to view using property binding.
- Now when user types in the field, we listen to the change event.
- Then update the value of the state variable.
- Updated state flows again from model to view.

> Same pattern can be observed during parent child communication.

- Parent sends initial state to the child.
- Child listens to the events and ask parent to update it's state.
- Parent's state updates and child receives a new value.

  So, a general pattern here is listening to events and then updating the state. This is where two way binding hepls.
