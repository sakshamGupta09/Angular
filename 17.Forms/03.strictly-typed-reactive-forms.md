# Typed Forms

- Most of the form API's we interact with, like `form.value`, `form.get('')`, `form.controls` etc. are not type safe.
- Most of these APIs included `any` somewhere in their types, and interacting with the structure of the controls, or the values themselves, was not type-safe. 


## FormControl

- `const email = new FormControl('angularrox@gmail.com');`.
- The type of email is automatically infered as `FormControl<string|null>`.
