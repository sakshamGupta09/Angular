# Custom events using output function

- The goal is to create custom events in our child components.
- There are two ways of doing so.
- One is using instance of `EventEmitter` class.
- Another and better way is to use `output` function.

## Syntax

`onNameChange = output<string>()    // OutputEmitterRef<string>`

## Subscribing programatically

- There are two ways to render a component in the DOM.
- One is to use a component selector in the template.
- Another is to programatically render a component. In this way we do not invoke it from the template.
- Then, how will we listen to our custom events?
- `const myComp = viewContainerRef.createComponent(...);`
- `myComp.instance.onNameChange.subscribe(newName => {})`
- Angular will automatically cleanup the subscription when child component is destroyed.
