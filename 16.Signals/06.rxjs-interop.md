# rxjs-interop

- Angular's `@angular/core/rxjs-interop` package provides useful utilities to integrate Angular Signals with RxJS Observables.


## toSignal

- A function to create a signal from rxjs observables.
- It subscibes to the observable immediately and creates a subscription.
- Whenever the observable emits values, signal calls it's set or update method.
- Automatically unsubscribes when the component or service destroys.
