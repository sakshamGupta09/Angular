# Input Alias

- Parent wants to send data to child.
- Parent uses the same property name that child used while declaring @Input.
- Suppose the property name in the child is updated, We have to update that in parent as well.
- Let's say our input property name resembles DOM nodes like id, class etc. In that case there can be confusion regarding
  whether it was a dom property we are setting or passing data to child component.

`@Input({alias: 'sliderValue'}) value = 0`

`<custom-slider [sliderValue]="50" />`
