# rxjs-interop

- Angular's `@angular/core/rxjs-interop` package provides useful utilities to integrate Angular Signals with RxJS Observables.


## toSignal

- A function to create a signal from rxjs observables.
- It subscibes to the observable immediately and creates a subscription.
- Whenever the observable emits values, signal calls it's set or update method.
- Automatically unsubscribes when the component or service destroys.
- `toSignal` by default needs to run in an injection context.
- `toSignal` creates a subscription. You should avoid calling it repeatedly for the same Observable, and instead reuse the signal it returns.
- [Example](https://angular.dev/guide/signals/rxjs-interop#tosignal)

## Error and Completion

- If an Observable used in toSignal produces an error, that error is thrown when the signal is read.
- If an Observable used in toSignal completes, the signal continues to return the most recently emitted value before completion.
