# Required inputs

- Parent has to supply a value to its' child.
- But is it mandatory or otional? What if parent forgets to send the value?.
- If we want that parent must supply a value we should configure required to true.
- Now, if parent does not supply a value, the compiler will throw an error.
- `  @Input({required: true}) value = 0;`
