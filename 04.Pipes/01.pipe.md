# Pipes

## Why

- Data flows from model to view.
- I do not want the same model property to be rendered.
- I want a variation of it.
- There are two ways to do so.
- I can do it in the model itself and view will automatically recieve transformed value.
- Or I can do it in the template also.

## Disadvantages of tranforming data in the model

- We want to transform a property in the class.
- We need to ensure that our transform function runs whenever the class property changes.
- No reusability. I can reuse the transform function by using it in a service, but still I need to inject service in all the
  components and run transformation logic whenever data changes.

## What are pipes

- Pipes are functions used in the template, that takes some input and return a transformed value.
- Returned value is then rendered in the view.
- Whenever we use a pipe, the whole expression becomes a function that takes some input and returns a value that is then 
  rendered.

## Advantages

- Better reusability.
- Model remains unchanges.
