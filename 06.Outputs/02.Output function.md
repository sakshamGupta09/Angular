# Custom events using output function

- The goal is to create custom events in our child components.
- There are two ways of doing so.
- One is using instance of `EventEmitter` class.
- Another and better way is to use `output` function.

## Syntax

`onNameChange = output<string>()    // OutputEmitterRef<string>`
