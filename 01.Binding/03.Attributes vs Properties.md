# Attributes vs properties

- When we write HTML source code, we define attributes on element tags.
- But when browser parses this HTML it converts it into a tree called DOM.
- Corresponding to every HTML element, we have a node in the tree. This node is an object.
- And every object has a key value pair.
- The attributes on element becomes property in the node object.
- Sometimes there is one to one mapping like id, value, type etc.
- Sometimes it's not like class becomes className, colspan becomes colSpan, for becomes htmlFor.
