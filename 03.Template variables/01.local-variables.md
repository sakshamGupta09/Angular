# Local template variables

- Just like we use local variables inside of a function. 
- We can define a local variable in the template and re-use it across the template.
- Values can be any valid Angular expression.
- The expressions will be re-evaluated any time the template is executed.

## Assignability

- @let cannot be re-assigned within the template, however its value will be recomputed when Angular runs change detection.
- Behaves like a const.
- However if variable is of reference type, we can still mutate it.
- variable = something is not allowed.

## Scope

- Block scoped.
- If, for and switch creates a new scope and variables dclared inside this are not available outside.
- Variables declared inside @if and @for block are locally scoped within that block.
- Rest all variable declaration are global i.e can be used anywhere in the template.
