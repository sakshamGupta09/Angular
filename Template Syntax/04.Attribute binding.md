# Attribute binding

- Data flows in one direction from model to view.
- Used to set values of HTML element's attributes.
- Can be applied to any attribute.
- The accepted value is always a string. So, write a expression that resolves to a string.
- When the expression resolves to null or undefined, Angular removes the attribute altogether.
- Syntax is [attr.name-of-the-attribute].

## Use cases

## Binding Aria attributes

Because we do not have a corresponding property in DOM node.

` <button type="button" [attr.aria-label]="actionName">{{ actionName }} with Aria</button>`

## Bindig to colspan

`<tr><td [attr.colspan]="1 + 1">One-Two</td></tr>`
