# Forms

## Choosing an approach

- Angular provides two approaches to manage forms.
- Template driven and reactive.
- The key differences between the two are based on the four pointers which are


## 1. Setup of form model

- Form model refers to the form data defined in the component class.
- Both reactive and template forms use the common foundation classes which are `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, `FormArray` and `ControlValueAccessor`.
- The difference is how you create and manage the common form-control instances.

## ControlValueAccessor

- We use form elements like `input`, `select`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `textarea` etc. in our UI.
- For every form element in the UI, we have a corresponding `FormControl` in our model.
- But how do the interact with each other.
- Using ControlValueAccessor.

## Setup in reactive forms

- Form model is explicitly defined(in a clear way) in the component class.
- Instance of form control is manually and explicitly created.
- `favoriteColorControl = new FormControl('');`
- We also have a form element in the UI and we want to sync both of them.
- The `[formControl]` directive links the explicitly created `FormControl` instance to a form element in the UI.
