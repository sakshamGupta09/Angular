# Programmatically rendering components

- Generally we invoke our components in the template and can control their visibility using `@If`.
- But in doing so- we have to add it in the imports, hence the component's source code is loaded.
- In addition to invoking a component in the template there are two other ways to render components dynamically.
- In template using `NgComponentOutlet`.
- TypeScript code with `ViewContainerRef`.

> We can render components dynamically but what about the inputs, outputs, content projection?

## Using NgComponentOutlet

- `NgComponentOutlet` is a structural directive that dynamically renders a given component in a template.
- `NgComponentOutlet` requires a component type, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and any existing
  component will be destroyed.
- [Syntax and Examples](https://angular.dev/api/common/NgComponentOutlet?tab=api)
