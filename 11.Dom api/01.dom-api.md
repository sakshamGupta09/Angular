# Using DOM APIs

- Angular handles most DOM creation, updation and removal for us.
- We access our DOM nodes to modify attributes, properties, styling or attach listeners.
- Angular does all of that for us using bindings.
- But we might rarely have to interact with component's DOM.
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation whenever possible.
- Always prefer expressing your DOM's structure in component templates and updating that DOM with bindings.

## Get reference to component's host

- `constructor(elementRef: ElementRef) {}`.
- elementRef will refer to the component's host. We can write this in any component or directive.
- The `nativeElement` property references the host Element instance.
- Then we can query for the elements present in the template which are children of host.
- `elementRef.nativeElement.querySelector('input')?.focus();`
