# Class and style binding

We could have used attribute and property binding as well like [attr.class] or [className]. But since it's such a common operation
we have class and style bindings explicitly available.

## Binding to a single class

`[class.sale]="onSale"`

If the expression evaluates to a truthy value, class will be dynamically added else removed.

## Binding to multiple classes

`[class]="classExpression"`

**Class expression can be**

1. String of class names

  `"my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3"`

2. An object with class names as the keys and truthy or falsy expressions as the values.

  `public classNames = { a: true, b: false, c: true };`

3. An array of class names.

  `['foo', 'bar']`

> IMPORTANT: With any object-like expression—such as object, Array, Map, or Set —the identity of the object must change
 for Angular to update the class list. Updating the property without changing object identity has no effect.
