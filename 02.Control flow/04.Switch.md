# Switch

## Why

- We have a variable or expression.
- It can have multiple possible values.
- For each value, we have to execute some different logic.

## Syntax

@switch (condition) {  
  @case (caseA) {  
    Case A.  
  }  
  @case (caseB) {  
    Case B.  
  }  
  @default {  
    Default case.  
  }  
}

> The value of the conditional expression is compared to the case expression using the === operator.

> @switch does not have fallthrough, so you do not need an equivalent to a break or return statement.

> The @default block is optional and can be omitted. If no @case matches the expression and there is no @default block, nothing is shown.
