# Using DOM APIs

- We use DOM API's to modify attributes, properties, styling or attach listeners.
- Angular handles most DOM creation, updation and removal for us.
- Always prefer expressing your DOM's structure in component templates and updating that DOM with bindings.
- Angular does all of that for us using bindings.
- But we might rarely have to interact with component's DOM.

## Mistakes to avoid

- Avoid direct DOM manipulation whenever possible.
- Never directly manipulate the DOM inside of other Angular lifecycle hooks.
- Further, reading or modifying the DOM during other lifecycle hooks can negatively impact page performance by causing layout thrashing.

## Get reference to component's host

- `constructor(elementRef: ElementRef) {}`.
- elementRef will refer to the component's host. We can write this in any component or directive.
- The `nativeElement` property references the host Element instance.
- Then we can query for the elements present in the template which are children of host.
- `elementRef.nativeElement.querySelector('input')?.focus();`
