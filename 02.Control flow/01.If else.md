# @If block conditionsals

- When the condition expression is truthy, then only content is rendered to the DOM.
- The syntax is very similar to JS version except we use @ as a prefix.
- It supports else if and else as well.

@if (a > b) {
  {{a}} is greater than {{b}}
} @else if (b > a) {
  {{a}} is less than {{b}}
} @else {
  {{a}} is equal to {{b}}
}
