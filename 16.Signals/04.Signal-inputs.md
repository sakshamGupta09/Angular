# Signal inputs

## Benifits over `@Input` decorator

- Signal inputs are more type safe.
- Required inputs do not require initial values, or tricks to tell TypeScript that an input always has a value.
- Signal inputs, when used in templates, will automatically mark `OnPush` components as dirty.
- Values can be easily derived whenever an input changes using computed.
- Easier and more local monitoring of inputs using effect instead of ngOnChanges or setters.

## What are signal inputs

- Signal inputs accept a value from parent and convert it into a signal.
- Parent will pass a value to child which will be converted into a signal. 
- We could pass the signal from the parent as well but that is considered an anti pattern as child can update it.
