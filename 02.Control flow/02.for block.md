# @for block - repeaters

## Why do we need any loop in general

- We have a task T.
- We want to perform it n times.
- So instead of writing code for that task n times, we use a loop.

## Why

- Task is to render a user.
- I want to render 100 such users.
- We need a loop to perform this task n times.

## Basic for loop

@for (item of items; track item.id) {  
   {{ item.name }}  
}

This is very similar to the for of loop we use in javascript.
