# Using pipes in the template

- Import the pipe in the imports array of the component's class file.
- `<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>`


## Additional parameters

- Since pipe is a function, it can take many parameters.
- The first parameter is by default passed to the pipe function.
- Additional parameters are supplied using `:`
- `<p>The current time is: {{ currentTime | date:'hh:mm':'UTC' }}</p>`


## Chaining pipes

- You can connect multiple pipes so that the output of one pipe becomes the input to the next.
- `<p>The hero's birthday is in {{ today | date | uppercase }}</p>`
