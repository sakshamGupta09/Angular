# Model inputs

## Why

- Signal inputs are readonly. We cannot update it's value.
- Model inputs allow us to write values to a signal.
- `checked = model(false);`
- When we write a value to a model input, angular can update the value in the parent component as well. This is called two way data binding as values flow in both directions.
