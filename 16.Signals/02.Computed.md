# Computed signals

- Read only. Cannot update manually using `set` or `update`.
- Provide a list of dependencies and it will compute a value everytime any one of the deps change.
- Example updating cart count and subtotal when the cart products array changes.
- `const doubleCount: Signal<number> = computed(() => count() * 2);`
- Count is now a dependency and everytime value of count changes the function will compute a new value.
