# Bindings

Angular component has a view (HTML file) and a model(ts file). We want to establish communication between the two.

## Why

- To establish communication between model and view.

- Data will flow from model to view.

- Events will flow from view to model.

- This can be achieved by bindings.


## Examples of bindings

- Text interpolation
- Attribute binding
- Property binding
- Event binding
- Two way data binding
