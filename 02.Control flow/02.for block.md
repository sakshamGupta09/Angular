# @for block - repeaters

## Why do we need any loop in general

- We have a task T.
- We want to perform it n times.
- So instead of writing code for that task n times, we use a loop.

## Why

- Task is to render a user.
- I want to render 100 such users.
- We need a loop to perform this task n times.

## Basic for loop

@for (item of items; track item.id) {  
   {{ item.name }}  
}

This is very similar to the for of loop we use in javascript.


## Why do we need Track ?

- There needs to be mapping between our array elements in the model and the elements in the DOM.
- Angular could use index as a key but what happens when we perform insertion, deletion or sorting ?
- In that case the order of elemnts will change and Angular will tear down the previously rendered list and render a new list.
- That costs performance especially if the list size is very big.
- So we specify a unique identifier that can map an element in the DOM to corresponding array value.
- So that angular performs mimimal DOM updates.

## $index and other contextual variables

Inside the for block we can access some useful context variables like $Index etc. 
See the full list [here](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/control-flow#if-block-conditionals).

## Example

@for (item of items; track item.id; let idx = $index, e = $even) {   n
  Item #{{ idx }}: {{ item.name }}   
}

The aliasing is especially useful in case of using nested @for blocks where contextual variable names could collide.
