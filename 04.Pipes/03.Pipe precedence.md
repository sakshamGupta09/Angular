# Pipe precedence in template expressions

# Use case

- The pipe operator has lower precedence than other binary operators, including `+`,`-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&&`, `||`, and `??`.
- We are using a ternary expression and want to apply the pipe on the resultant value.
- But, pipe operator has a higher precedence than the JavaScript ternary operator (?:).
- `condition ? a : b | pipe`
- Since pipe has higher precedence, it is evaluated as `condition ? a : (b | pipe)`.
- Use parenthesis `(condition ? a : b) | pipe`
