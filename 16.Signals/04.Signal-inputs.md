# Signal inputs

## Benifits over `@Input` decorator

- Signal inputs are more type safe.
- Required inputs do not require initial values, or tricks to tell TypeScript that an input always has a value.
- Signal inputs, when used in templates, will automatically mark `OnPush` components as dirty.
- Values can be easily derived whenever an input changes using computed.
- Easier and more local monitoring of inputs using effect instead of ngOnChanges or setters.

## What are signal inputs

- Signal inputs accept a value from parent and convert it into a signal.
- When the value changes, signal will call `set` or `update` behind the scenes.
- We could pass the signal from the parent as well but that is considered an anti pattern as child can update it.
- Signal inputs are read only.

## Optional inputs

- Parent can skip passing the value.
- If no value is passed default value is used or undefined if no default value is supplied.
- `count = input()`

## Required inputs

- Parent must supply a value.
- Does not require initialization.
- `count = input.required<number>()`
