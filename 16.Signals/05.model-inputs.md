# Model inputs

## Why

- Signal inputs are readonly. We cannot update it's value.
- Model inputs allow us to write values to a signal.
- `checked = model(false);`
- When we write a value to a model input, angular can update the value in the parent component as well. This is called two way data binding as values flow in both directions.
- If we want unidirection data flow, use signal inputs.
- If we want two way bindings, use model inputs.

## Two-way binding with signals

- Parent component has a signal property.
- Signal is passed to the child not the value. Till now we were passing a value which was converted to a signal.
- Both parent and child can write values to this signal.
- `<custom-checkbox [(checked)]="isAdmin" />`
- `protected isAdmin = signal(false);`
