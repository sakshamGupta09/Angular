# Change detection with pipes

## How default change detection works

- To keep model and view in sync, Angular needs to know when the data bound properties have changed.
- It runs a process called change detection to understand if the properties have changed or not.
- This process runs after every DOM event keystroke, mouse move, setTimeouts, setIntervals and observable subscriptions.
- In this process, if we are delaing with the reference types (Objects, arrays etc) Angular does a deep scan to understand if
  the properties have changed or not. This can cause performance issues.
- So, if we have an array and we push a new item, splice one or change properties of an object inside array, Angular will
  detect that change and update the view.
