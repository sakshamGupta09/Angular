# Empty block

## Why

- It is a very common use case to show a no data message when our array is empty.
- If the array has items, for block's code will execute.
- If it's an empty array, null, undefined, empty block's code will execute.
- It kind of works like if else statements. If array has items, execute for block else execute empty block.

## Syntax

@for (item of items; track item.name) {  
  `<li> {{ item.name }}</li>`  
} @empty {  
  `<li> There are no items.</li>`  
}
