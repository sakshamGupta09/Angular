# Content projection with ng-content

## Why

- To create reusable components.
- Some components do not know their content ahead of time.
- Example a dialog. We know it will always have a header, body and a footer. The structure remains same but on different pages
 of the application, the body might render a table, a form, details of a product etc.
- Other examples can be a card, collapsable panel etc.
- To dynamically pass content (HTML) from parent to children we need content projection.
