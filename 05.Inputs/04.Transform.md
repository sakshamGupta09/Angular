# Transform

- Parent sends some value but I want to transform it before using it in the child.
- The value that parent sends goes in as the input to a transform function.
- The value returned from function will be assigned to input property.
- Everytime parent send a new value or reference, transfrom function will execute.
- Transform function must always be a pure function.

## Example

## Type checking

- The type of transform function's parameter is the type that can be passed from parent.
- Since, whatever value parent passes goes through the transform function.

## Built in transformations

- Two very common transformations are
- numberAttribute Converting to a number.
- booleanAttribute converting to a boolean.

## booleanAttribute

- Provide anything as input, it will convert it to boolean.
- Mere presence of this attribute yields true.
- Absence does not mean false. It will take default value.
- Passing literal string "false" returns false.

## numberAttribute

- Typically used to convert string to a number like in route params.
- attempts to parse the given value to a number, producing NaN if parsing fails.
