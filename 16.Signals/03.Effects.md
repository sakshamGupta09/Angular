# Effects

- Effect is an operation that runs whenever any of the dependencies change.
- Similar to computed but we are not using dependencies to compute a signal value.
- Effect is like a onchange event which fires whenever deps change.
- Effects always run at least once.
- Dependencies can be dynamically added or removed.

## Use cases for effects

- Logging data being displayed and when it changes, either for analytics or as a debugging tool.
- Keeping data in sync with window.localStorage.

## When not to use effects

- Never set signal value inside effects. It can cause infinite circular updates.
- Angular by default prevents you from setting signals in effects. It can be enabled if absolutely necessary by setting the allowSignalWrites flag when you create an effect.
