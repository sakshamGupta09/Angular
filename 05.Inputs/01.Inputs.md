# Input properties

- Consider we have a image slider component or carousel.

## Why 

## Reusability

- I want to use this slider component in many places of my application. But everytime with some different
  set of images.
- Appearance and behavior of component remains same, only the data( array of images) will change.
- Parent component will pass this dynamic data as input properties.

## Customizations

- I now have a reusable slider component that I am using throughout my application.
- Now, If I am using it in customers component, Left and right arrow controls should not appear.
- In products component, this slider should not auto slide the images.
- In some other component, I do not want to have the controls at the bottom.
- Since we have a same reusable component, we can pass some input properties to customize it.

## Stateless components

- Create stateless components that focus purely on rendering the UI based on a given data.
- Such components are very simple and easier to debug and test.

## Single responsibility principle

- A component should perform only one task.
- If it ends up performing multiple tasks, break it down into smaller components.
