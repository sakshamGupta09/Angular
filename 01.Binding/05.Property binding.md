# Property binding

- Moves the data in one direction from model to view.
-  To set value of DOM node properties and component inputs.
-  We use [name of the property] = "Expression" for property binding.
-  Omiiting [] means the string value will be used and not the value from the model.
-  If null or undefined is supplied, same value is stored in the node unlike attribute binding.
