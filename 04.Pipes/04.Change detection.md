# Change detection with pipes

## How default change detection works

- To keep model and view in sync, Angular needs to know when the data bound properties have changed.
- It runs a process called change detection to understand if the properties have changed or not.
- This process runs after every DOM event keystroke, mouse move, setTimeouts, setIntervals and observable subscriptions.
- In this process, if we are delaing with the reference types (Objects, arrays etc) Angular does a deep scan to understand if
  the properties have changed or not. This can cause performance issues.
- So, if we have an array and we push a new item, splice one or change properties of an object inside array, Angular will
  detect that change and update the view.


## When pipe executes

## Pure pipes

- By default every pipe is pure.
- Pure pipe means it executes only and only if it's input parameters have changed.
- That means if primitives value has updated or a new reference is created for reference types.
- If you mutate an array or an object, pipe will not execute.
- Highly performant as no deep scan is performed.

## Impure pipes

- Executes everytime after a change is detected.
- Even if that change is not in the input parameters.
- Can lead to performance issues.
- Will execute if a reference type is mutated.
