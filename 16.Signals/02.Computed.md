# Computed signals

- Read only. Cannot update manually using `set` or `update`.
- Provide a list of dependencies and it will compute a value everytime any one of the deps change.
- We are watching some signals closely and whenever they change we compute a value using them.
- Example updating cart count and subtotal when the cart products array changes.
- `const doubleCount: Signal<number> = computed(() => count() * 2);`
- Count is now a dependency and everytime value of count changes the function will compute a new value.

## Lazy evaluation and memoization

- The derivation function only runs when we are reading a value. If no value is read it will never execute. Hence lazy.
- The calculated value is then cached, and if you read it again, it will return the cached value without recalculating.
- If the deps change, angular knows that cached value is no longer valid, and when we read the value next time, new value will be calculated.

## Computed signal dependencies are dynamic

- Whatever value we read inside derivation function become it's dependencies.
- If we are conditionally reading values inside derivation function, deps are also updated.
