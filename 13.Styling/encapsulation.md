# Styling components

## Style scoping

## Why do we need style scoping

- **Style conflicts** Everytime a new class is introduced, we have to check if that class with same name exists.
- That makes our codebase hard to maintain.
- **Maintaining Component Encapsulation** We can be certain that styles introduced in a component won't affect other 
  components.
