# Conditional rendering

## Why

- I have written some HTML but I want to show it to the user only if some condition is met.
- The elements are dynamically added or removed from the DOM and not hidden.

## How

- When the condition expression is truthy, then only content is rendered to the DOM.
- The syntax is very similar to JS version except we use @ as a prefix.
- It supports else if and else as well.

## Syntax

@if (a > b) {  
  {{a}} is greater than {{b}}  
} @else if (b > a) {  
  {{a}} is less than {{b}}  
} @else {  
  {{a}} is equal to {{b}}  
}
