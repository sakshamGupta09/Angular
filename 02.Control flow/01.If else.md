# @If block conditionsals

## Why

- To do conditional rendering.
- I have written some HTML but I want to show it to the user only if some condition is met.

## How

- When the condition expression is truthy, then only content is rendered to the DOM.
- The syntax is very similar to JS version except we use @ as a prefix.
- It supports else if and else as well.


@if (a > b) {  
 {{a}} is greater than {{b}}  
 }
