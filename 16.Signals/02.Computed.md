# Computed signals

- Read only. Cannot update manually using `set` or `update`.
- Derive their value from other signals.
- To compute a new value everytime a signal value changes.
- Example updating cart count and subtital when the cart products array changes.
- Signals defined inside computed are it's dependencies and the function executes everytime any of the deps change.
