# Component host elements

- We can invoke our component using type, attribute or class selector.
- The DOM element that matches with the component's selector is called the host element.
- The contents of component's template are rendered inside this host element always.
- There will always be a host element which can be component name, or DOM element depending upon the component selector.

## Binding to host element

- We can use property bindings, attribute bindings
