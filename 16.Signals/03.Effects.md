# Effects

- Effect is an operation that runs whenever any of the dependencies change.
- Similar to computed but we are not using dependencies to compute a signal value.
- Effect is like a onchange event which fires whenever deps change.
- Effects always run at least once.
- Dependencies can be dynamically added or removed.

## Use cases for effects

- Logging data being displayed and when it changes, either for analytics or as a debugging tool.
- Keeping data in sync with window.localStorage.
