# Bindings

Angular component has a view (HTML file) and a model(ts file). They cannot work independently and have to work together. So, they mst communicate with each other.

## Why

- To establish communication between model and view.
- Data will flow from model to view.
- Events will flow from view to model.
- This can be achieved by bindings.


## Examples of bindings

- Text interpolation
- Attribute binding
- Property binding
- Event binding
- Two way data binding

## But why do we need data in the view ?

- Because we are not dealing with static HTML pages.
- We want to fetch data from DB and render the dynamic data onto the UI.
- So that user can then interact with it.
- To manipulate the DOM nodes like change appearance or styles.
