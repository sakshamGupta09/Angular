# Content projection with ng-content

## Why

- To create reusable components.
- Some components do not know their content ahead of time.
- Example a dialog. We know it will always have a header, body and a footer. The structure remains same but on different pages
 of the application, the body might render a table, a form, details of a product etc.
- Other examples can be a card, collapsable panel etc.
- To dynamically pass content (HTML) from parent to children we need content projection.
- Like we send inputs from parent to child, now we are sending kdynamic content.

## How to use it

- In the child we place special placeholders `ng-content` to tell angular where we wish to accept dynamic data.
- In the parent while invoking the component whatever is placed inside the component tag is what will be projected to child.
- `<custom-card><p>This is the projected content</p></custom-card>`
