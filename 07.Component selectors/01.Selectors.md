# Component selectors

- I want to render a child component in my template.
- What all ways are there to call a component in the template.
- Inside the metadata of `@component` decorator we have a property called selector which is used to render correct component.


## Type selector

- Call the component like a regular HTML element `<app-profile>`.
- Inside the metadata there is a property called selector.
- Selector's value must match with the HTML element.


## Attribute selector

- Use predefined attributes like name, type or any custom attribute like mat-button.
- When we want to extend the functionality of native web elements like button, input etc. we use attribute selector.
- Otherwise if we use a normal type selector, we will have to pass a lot of inputs like disabled, click, name, aria labels etc.
- Syntax is `selector: button[type="submit"][name="saksham"]`.
- The button element which posess attributes like type="submit" and name="saksham" will render the component inside it.

## Class selector

- Define a class in the selector prefixed with a dot.
- `selector = ".menu-list"`
- Any HTML element which posesses this class will render the component inside it.

> The value of attributes and classes is compared using equality operator.
