# Signal queries

- We use queries to get reference to a component, directive or a DOM node.
- Since we are using signals, everytime query result changes, reactive functions like `computed` and `effect` runs.

## viewChild

- `divEl = viewChild<ElementRef>('el')  // Signal<ElementRef|undefined>`.
- `cmp = viewChild(MyComponent); // Signal<MyComponent|undefined>`

## View query options

- First argument is the locator. What are wwe looking for a component, directive or a DOM node.
- Second to configure the behavior of the query.
- View queries accept only one configuration which is `read`.

## Content queriey options

-  First argument is the locator. What are wwe looking for a component, directive or a DOM node.
- Second to configure the behavior of the query.
- Content queries accept two configurations which is `read` and `descendants`.
