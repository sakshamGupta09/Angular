# Bindings

Angular component has a view (HTML file) and a model(ts file). We want to establish communication between the two.

## Why

- To establish communication between model and view.

- Synchronize model and view.

- We have some properties defined in our class and want to access those in our view.

- When the value in the class changes, I want UI to update accordinglly.

- Model wants to listen to the user actions or events occouring in the view.

## What

Binding creates a live connection between our model and the view. This connection can be used to transfer data in both directions. Model will transfer data to the view and view will notify when events occour.

> Angular's change detection algorithm is responsible for keeping model and view in sync.

## Examples of bindings

- Text interpolation
- Attribute binding
- Property binding
- Event binding
- Two way data binding
