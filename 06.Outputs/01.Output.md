# Outputs

## Why

- We have created stateless components with inputs whose sole focus is accepting some data and to render it.
- Users might interact with these stateless components like click, enter, drag and drop etc.
- Since they themselves do not manage any state, the must inform the parent that an action has occoured.
- This is achieved using outputs. We create custom events that parent can listen to.
- This ensures unidirectional data flow. Always from parent to child. So the components are easy to read and maintain.


## Example

- We have a parent component that renders a `table` component and a `filters` component.
- Parent component is responsible for managing api calls to fetch the data.
- When user selects some filters and press apply, we need to make another call to fetch filtered list.
- But calls are trigerred from parent only.
- So, `filters` component must inform the parent and ask to make another call.

## Syntax

- `@Output() panelClosed = new EventEmitter<void>();`
- Declare an event in the child component using above syntax.
- Use angular's event binding to listen to this event in the parent component.
- We create events in the child component which parent can listen to.

## Choosing event names

- Avoid names which are similar to DOM events like click, hover etc.
- Names should be camelCased.
- `on` prefix should not be used.
